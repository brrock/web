We decided to have theme dinners every Saturday night over lock down and last weekend we made one of my favourite nights from lock down again - Mexican - chicken fajitas and beef tacos! 



Other weekends in lock down we enjoyed Japanese (we made sushi and teriyaki chicken), Italian (homemade pizzas and pasta), American (burgers of course!), Indian (curry, daal, naan, poppadoms and rice) and Greek (we made chicken souvlaki kebabs and lamb koftas) - Mummy actually smashed a plate - by accident - apparently that’s what they do in Greek restaurants so it was funny! We try and listen to the country's music when we are eating but sometimes the Amazon Alexa can't find anything that good for some of the themes!

For the beef tacos we bought taco shells from the supermarket and filled them with a beef mix made by frying onion and garlic together before adding some beef mince, tomato puree, water and spices together. I don't like taco shells but I had some of the yummy meat with rice and a wrap.  The beef mix doesn't look good but it tastes great.

Next we griddled red peppers and courgettes (for Mummy and Daddy!), we then griddled chicken breast pieces until cooked through and added cooked garlic, onion as well as fajita seasoning. We added the peppers and courgettes back to this and served it with tortilla wraps, lettuce wraps (for Mummy!), sweetcorn, cucumber sticks, brown rice, smashed avocado with lime and coriander, grated cheese and sour cream (both for Sam).  

The meal was really good. Let me know in the comments below if you have any good theme night suggestions please! To comment you need to be signed in with a gmail account as this blog is powered by google's blogger.
